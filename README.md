## Aim

We compare state-of-the-art Network Propagation with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), using protein-protein interaction data and known disease genes to construct the graph. We aim to assess and compare how well these methods can prioritize candidate genes for further biological validation. As an example use case, we identify new genes potentially involved in Hereditary Ataxia. 

## Why?

Medical genetics aims at diagnosing patients by finding genetic variants explaining their disease. While approximately half of the patients with rare genetic disease receive a genetic diagnosis, the other half remains undiagnosed, and one of the reasons is genetic variants in genes currently unknown to be disease-associated. Since experimental studies are usually quite expensive and time-consuming, in silico disease-gene prioritization is very useful in the discovery of new disease-genes. By ranking genes, the methods provide sets of the most promising new candidate genes relevant for a disease.

Currently, novel bioinformatics methods, such as graph neural networks are increasingly popular. The huge number of such methods requires further understanding of how they compare to previous methods and how useful they can be for further studies. In particular, it is of crucial importance for bioinformaticians to provide only high-confidence candidates for experimental validation. Therefore, during the hackathon we aimed at comparing the performance of graph neural networks with network propagation methods.

As an illustrative case we used hereditary ataxia - a rare, genetically complex disease, with many cases still unexplained despite years of investigations. Network-based methods can highlight functionally related genes that don't stand out in standard analyses. Compared to Network Propagation, GNNs may offer less bias and improved performance in recognizing complex patterns, but are dependent on advanced configuration and more computationally demanding. Our project explores the potential and limitations of these two types of models.

## Methods

Main tools to base our work on: 
- https://github.com/geneDRAGNN/geneDRAGNN
- https://github.com/GiDeCarlo/XGDAG
- https://github.com/anthbapt/multixrank

Graph neural networks require as input:
- biological network (protein-protein interaction constructed with BioGRID and Reactome)
- a list of known disease genes for ataxia from https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/
- node features: we used gene expression in cerebellum from the GTEx database (https://www.gtexportal.org) and case/control variants statistics from the AstraZeneca PheWAS Portal (https://azphewas.com/)

### How to use this repo

Why clone it? How to use it? Why and how build upon it?

Draft: to apply the methods we validated as working, to research further rare diseases in a similar fashion. To expand this project into a more comprehensive benchmarking of available methods.

### Pipeline testing

README

geneDRAGNN testing pipeline

This project demonstrates how to use the pretrained model from the geneDRAGNN repository to generate disease relevance scores for genes using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model trained on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) data.

üîç What This Does
- Loads a pretrained MLP model: MLP_node_trial99.ckpt
- Accepts node features of shape (N, 107)
- Outputs predicted gene scores in gene_scores.csv

üß™ Setup

1. Clone the Repo
git clone https://github.com/hanikhatib/geneDRAGNN.git
cd geneDRAGNN

2. Install Requirements (CPU)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio pandas numpy
pip install torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.1.0+cpu.html
pip install torch-sparse -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.1.0+cpu.html
pip install torch-geometric

3. Prepare Input Files
Place gene_features_107.csv and gene_names.csv in the repo folder.

4. Run Inference
python3 run_gene_score_inference_final_v2.py

‚úÖ Output:
gene_scores.csv with pathogenicity relevance scores.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- The pretrained model is trained for Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
- Using this model for other diseases will require retraining.


## Results
The list of the top 20 prioritized genes for Ataxia using the geneDRAGNN tool that was trained on LUAD
